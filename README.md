# Introduction to Machine Learning

Course that provides an introduction to Machine Learning for PhD Students at TUM.

The content of the course is divided in 4 sessions (3h each):

S1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Preparation. 

  Goal: Build a conceptual foundation and introduce the ML workflow with a focus on data.
    
  Outline:
    
   - What is Machine Learning (ML)?
      
   - Types of ML.
      
   - ML Workflow.
      
   - Data handling and Preprocessing.
      
S2: Supervised Learning: Classification and Regression.
    Goal: Learn the foundations of *supervised ML* and practice with real datasets.
    Outline:
      - Supervised Learning concepts.
      - Classification algorithms.
      - Regression algorithms.
      
S3: Unsupervised Learning: Clustering methods and Dimensionality reduction.
    Goal: Learn the foundations of *unsupervised ML* and introduce techniques for discovering patterns without labels.
    Outline:
      - Unsupervised Learning concepts.
      - Clustering methods.
      - Dimensionality reduction.
      
S4: Model Evaluation and Applications in Research
    Goal: Learn how to evaluate ML models and best practices to apply the concepts to your own projects.
    Outline:
      - Model evaluation metrics.
      - Best practices in ML research.
